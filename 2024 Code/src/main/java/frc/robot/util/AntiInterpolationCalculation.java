     * Anti-interpolation equation. Arm position is on the y-axis and is
     * measured in degrees, distance is on the x-axis, radial from the speaker, and
     * measured in meters, This solution is "laser-pointer," meaning that it does
     * not account for gravity.
     * 
     * With this equation, shoot whilst swerving would be solved by simply
     * scheduling the target arm angle further from the current radial distance
     * depending on the robot velocity. Since the problem is now being treated in a
     * robot oriented fashion (auto-align is assumed to continually and perfectly
     * update angle to speaker), side-to-side movement (VsubY) is insignificant.
     * 
     * Robot velocity is assumed to be constant as the robot accelerates to its
     * desired speed almost instantly. If acceleration becomes necessary to
     * implement in the future, an alternate solution of directly reading the
     * driver's stick inputs to see if movement in a direction will be requested to
     * the swerve may be easier than actually including acceleration in the
     * equation.
     * 
     * In the future, a slight "flick" in robot orientation right before the shot
     * may be necessary if the auto-align cannot keep up with robot movement.
     * 
     * @param radialDist The shortest distance between the robot and the speaker.
     * @return An angle in radians above the horizontal which will score if the note
     *         is shot from the ground level.
